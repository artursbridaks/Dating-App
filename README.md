**Dating App**

The project was developed as a final work to graduate from the coding bootcamp. The main influence of the project 
functionality and look was Tinder. The page was developed in the time frame of 2 weeks.   

**Instructions**

To open the project, clone it to your local machine. Open the terminal in the root folder 
and write the following command:

* php artisan serve (then click on the link)

**Description**

The app was developed on PHP Laravel framework. The data - users, profiles, pictures, likes/ dislikes etc. were saved 
using MySQL database. For testing and visual presentation, the test data was generated using a built-in "faker" 
function. Main features of the app are - profile edit page (which saves data across two databases), liking and 
disliking option, matching and showing matches. An additional function was created - when two users match (have liked 
each other), an email is sent to both users using "mailtrap.io" service.

**Description**

The project was developed in a relatively short time period. If more time was given, I would pay more attention to the 
details, work on more complex functions and improve the existing ones. All in all, I learned a lot while working on 
this project. After finishing all the main functionality, I feel much more confident about my abilities as a programmer.
